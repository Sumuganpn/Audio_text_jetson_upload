English Rose

what tender beauty lays before me
I call her my English rose

lips red like petals and as soft
earthen eyes | could sink into
breathless | look on captivated

if only | could bathe in her scent
lay my head upon her bosom

and sleep against the softest skin
how beautiful my English rose

how strong this feeling pines

at my thoughts into my soul

here is a beauty unlike any other
tenderly sweet before my eye

| could hold this picture forever
and forever love my English rose
